sinatra-portfolio-project

This is an app helping parents keep track if children know their lessons and do their homeworks.

Parents can create a log-in. Each child can have their own login also. The parent log in controls which lesson and homework are available. They can also view the record of each child to see what they have completed on a particular day.

Each child can access their record for the day and update what assignments they have completed.
